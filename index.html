 What is space?
    </h2>    
    <br> <br>
    <p>
        Space is an almost perfect vacuum, nearly void of matter and with extremely low pressure.
     In space, sound doesn't carry because there aren't molecules close enough together to transmit 
     sound between them. Not quite empty, bits of gas, dust and other matter floats around "emptier" 
     areas of the universe, while more crowded regions can host planets, stars and galaxies.
    </p>
    <br>
    <div class="row">
        <P>
            From our Earth-bound perspective, outer space is most often thought to begin about 62 miles 
            (100 kilometers) above sea level at what is known as the Kármán line. This is an imaginary 
            boundary at an altitude where there is no appreciable air to breathe or scatter light. 
            Passing this altitude, blue starts to give way to black because oxygen molecules are not 
            in enough abundance to make the sky blue.
        </P>

    <p>
    No one knows exactly how big space is. It's difficult to determine because of what we can see
    in our detectors. We measure long distances in space in "light-years," representing the distance
    it takes for light to travel in a year (roughly 5.8 trillion miles (9.3 trillion kilometers)). 
</p>
 <p>
 From the light that is visible in our telescopes, we have charted galaxies reaching almost as far
 back as the Big Bang, which is thought to have started our universe about 13.8 billion years ago.
 This means we can "see" into space at a distance of almost 13.8 billion light-years. But the 
 universe continues to expand, making "measuring space," even more challenging. 
</p>
<p>
Additionally, astronomers are not totally sure if our universe is the only one that exists. This 
means that space could be a whole lot bigger than we even think.
</p>

<h2>Invisible Radiaton</h2>
<br> <br>
<p>
    The majority of space is relatively empty, with just stray bits of dust and gas floating 
    around. This means that when humans send a probe to a distant planet or asteroid, the craft 
    will not encounter "drag" in the same way that an airplane does as it sails through space.
</p>
<br>
<p>
    the vacuum environment in space and on the moon, is one reason why the lunar lander of the 
    Apollo program was designed to have an almost spider-like appearance, as it was described 
    by the Apollo 9 crew. Because the spacecraft was designed to work in a zone with no atmosphere, 
    it didn't need to have smooth edges or an aerodynamic shape.
</p>
<br>

<p>
        In addition to the bits of debris that speckle the "emptier" regions of space, 
        research has shown that these areas are also home to different forms of radiation. 
        In our own solar system, the solar wind — charged particles that stream from the 
        sun — emanate throughout the solar system and occasionally cause auroras near Earth's 
        poles. Cosmic rays also fly through our neighborhood, stemming from supernovas outside of
        the solar system.
</p>
<br>
<p>
    In fact, the universe as a whole is inundated with what is known as the cosmic microwave 
    background (CMB), which is essentially the leftover radiation from the explosion mostly 
    commonly known as the Big Bang. The CMB is the oldest radiation that our instruments can 
    detect.
</p>
<br> <br>
<h3>More about CMB</h3>
<div class="row">
    <p>
        The Cosmic Microwave Background, or CMB, is radiation that fills the universe and can be 
        detected in every direction. Microwaves are invisible to the naked eye so they cannot be 
        seen without instruments. Created shortly after the universe came into being in the Big 
        Bang, the CMB represents the earliest radiation that can be detected. Astronomers have 
        likened the CMB to seeing sunlight penetrating an overcast sky.
    </p>
    <img src="cmbs.jpeg" width="350" height="300">
</div>
<p>
    Looking out into deep space, and therefore back into deep time, astronomers see the CMB 
    radiation saturating space beginning at about 378,000 years after the Big Bang. 
    Before the creation of the CMB, the universe was a hot, dense and opaque plasma containing 
    both matter and energy. Photons could not travel freely, so no light escaped from those earlier times.

    <h2>Dark matter & energy</h2>
    <br> <br>
    <p>There remain two giant mysteries about space: dark matter and dark energy. </p>
<br>
<p>While scientists have provided extensive evidence for the existence of dark matter and dark 
energy, they are each still poorly understood as, so far, scientists cannot directly observe them
and can only observe their effects.
</p>
<br>
<p>
    Roughly 80% of all of the mass in the universe is made up of what scientists have dubbed 
    "dark matter," but it's not known what it actually is or if it is even matter by our current 
    definition. However, while dark matter doesn't emit light or energy and cannot, therefore, 
    be directly observed, scientists have found overwhelming evidence that it makes up the vast 
    majority of the matter in the cosmos.
</p>
<br>
<p>
    Dark energy might have a similar name to dark matter, but it's a whole different component 
    entirely.
</p>
<br>
<h3>What is dark matter?</h3>
<p> 
   Most scientists think that dark matter is composed of non-baryonic matter. The lead candidate, 
   WIMPS (weakly interacting massive particles), are believed to have ten to a hundred times the 
   mass of a proton, but their weak interactions with "normal" matter make them difficult to 
   detect
</p>
<br> <br>
<p>
    Thought to make up nearly 75% of the universe, dark energy is a mysterious and unknown force 
    or entity that scientists think is responsible for the universe's ongoing expansion.

<section id="black_holes">
    <h2>Black Holes</h2>
    <br> <br>
    <p>
        Smaller black holes can form from the gravitational collapse of a gigantic star, which 
        forms a singularity from which nothing can escape — not even light, hence the name of 
        the object. No one is quite sure what lies within a black hole, or what would happen to 
        a person or object who fell into it but research is ongoing
    </p>
    <br>
   <div id="black_hole">
    <p>
        An example is gravitational waves, or ripples in space-time that come from interactions 
        between black holes. This was first predicted by Albert Einstein at the turn of the last 
        century, when he showed that time and space are linked; time speeds up or slows down when 
        space is distorted.
    </p>
    <br>
    <img src="black hole.jpg" width="250" height="200"> 
   </div>
   <br>
   <p>
    As of mid-2017, the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) Scientific 
    Collaboration has announced three black-hole interactions and mergers detected through 
    gravitational waves, in just two years.
   </p>
   <br>
   <p>
    The team found these three events in about two years, indicating that when LIGO is 
    implemented at full sensitivity, the observatory may be able to find these sorts of events 
    frequently, scientists said in May 2017. Should a bunch of these black hole events be 
    detected, it could help scientists learn how black holes of a certain size (several tens of 
    sun masses) are born, and later merge into new black holes.

        Stars (like our own sun) are immense balls of gas that produce their own radiation. 
        They can range from red supergiants to cooling white dwarfs that are the leftovers of 
        supernovas, or star explosions that occur when a big one runs out of gas to burn.
        These explosions spread elements throughout the universe and are the reason that elements 
        such as iron exist. Star explosions can also give rise to incredibly dense objects called 
        neutron stars. If these neutron stars send out pulses of radiation, they are called 
        pulsar stars.Stars (like our own sun) are immense balls of gas that produce their own

   <div id="Planets">
    <p>
        Planets are objects whose definition came under scrutiny in 2006, when astronomers were 
        debating whether Pluto could be considered a planet or not. At the time, the 
        International Astronomical Union (the governing body on Earth for these decisions) ruled 
        that a planet is a celestial body that orbits the sun, is massive enough to have a 
        nearly round shape, and has cleared its orbit of debris. Under this designation, Pluto 
        and similar small objects are considered "dwarf planets," although not everyone agrees 
        with the designation. After the New Horizons spacecraft flew by Pluto in 2015, principal 
        investigator Alan Stern and others again opened up the debate, saying the diversity of 
        terrain on Pluto makes it more like a planet.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
        The definition of extrasolar planets, or planets outside the solar system, is still not 
        firmed up by the IAU, but essentially astronomers understand it to mean objects that 
        behave like planets in our neighborhood. The first such planet was found in 1992 
        (in the constellation Pegasus) and since that time, thousands of alien planets have been 
        confirmed — with many more suspected. In solar systems that have planets under formation, 
        these objects are often called "protoplanets" because they aren't quite the maturity of 
        those planets we have in our own solar system
    </p>
   </div> 
    <br>
    <p>
        Asteroids are rocks that are not quite big enough to be dwarf planets. We've even found 
        asteroids with rings around them, such as 10199 Charilko. Their small size often leads 
        to the conclusion that they were remnants from when the solar system was formed. Most 
        asteroids are concentrated in a belt between the planets Mars and Jupiter, but there are 
        also many asteroids that follow behind or ahead of planets, or can even cross in a 
        planet's path. NASA and several other entities have asteroid-searching programs in place 
        to scan for potentially dangerous objects in the sky and monitor their orbits closely. 
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
        In our solar system, comets (sometimes called dirty snowballs) are objects believed 
        to originate from a vast collection of icy bodies called the Oort Cloud. As a comet a
        pproaches the sun, the heat of our star causes ices to melt and stream away from the 
        comet. The ancients often associated comets with destruction or some sort of immense 
        change on Earth, but the discovery of Halley's Comet and related "periodic" or returning comets showed that they were ordinary solar system phenomena.

<section id="galaxies_and_quasars">
<h2>Galaxies & Quasars</h2>
<br> <br>
<p>
    Among the biggest cosmic structures we can see are galaxies, which essentially are vast 
    collections of stars. Our own galaxy is called the Milky Way, and is considered a "barred 
    spiral" shape. There are several types of galaxies, ranging from spiral to elliptical to 
    irregular, and they can change as they come close to other objects or as stars within them 
    age.
</p>
<br>
<p>
    Often galaxies have supermassive black holes embedded in the center of their galaxies, which 
    are only visible through the radiation that each black hole emanates as well as through its 
    gravitational interactions with other objects. If the black hole is particularly active, with 
    a lot of material falling into it, it produces immense amounts of radiation. This kind of a 
    galactic object is called a quasar (just one of several types of similar objects).
</p>
<br>
<p>
    Large groups of galaxies can form in clusters that are groups as large as hundreds or thousands 
    of galaxies bound together gravitationally. Scientists consider these the largest structures 
    in the universe.
